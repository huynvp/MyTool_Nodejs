== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

Many user interface improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated
Features” section below for more details.

Support for a number of legacy features and libraries has been removed.
See the “Removed Features and Support” section below for more details.

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark slowly leaked water under the kitchen sink over the course of several months, causing a big mess.

* Data following a TCP ZeroWindowProbe is marked as retransmission and not passed to subdissectors (wsbuglink:15427[])

* Lua Error on startup: init.lua: dofile has been disabled due to running Wireshark as superuser (wsbuglink:15489[]).

//_Non-empty section placeholder._

Text and Image columns were handled incorrectly for TDS 7.0 and 7.1. (wsbuglink:3098[])

Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes.
(wsbuglink:1419[])

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 3.0.0rc2:

* No significant changes.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 3.0.0rc1:

* The IP map feature (the “Map” button in the “Endpoints” dialog) has been
  added back in a modernized form (wsbuglink:14693[]).
* The macOS package now ships with Qt 5.12.1. Previously it shipped with
  Qt 5.9.7.
* The macOS package requires version 10.12 or later. If you're running an
  older version of macOS, please use Wireshark 2.6.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.9.0:

* Wireshark now supports the Swedish and Ukrainian languages.
* Initial support for using PKCS #11 tokens for RSA decryption in TLS. This can
  be configured at _Preferences_, _RSA Keys_.
* The build system now produces reproducible builds (wsbuglink:15163[]).
* The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.12.1. Previously they
  shipped with Qt 5.12.0.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.6.0:

* The Windows .exe installers now ship with https://nmap.org/npcap/[Npcap]
  instead of WinPcap.  Besides being actively maintained (by the nmap project),
  Npcap brings support for loopback capture and 802.11 WiFi monitor mode
  capture (if supported by the NIC driver).
* Conversation timestamps are supported for UDP/UDP-Lite protocols
* TShark now supports the `-G elastic-mapping` option which generates an ElasticSearch mapping file.
* The “Capture Information” dialog has been added back (wsbuglink:12004[]).
* The Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 dissectors no longer validate the frame check sequence (checksum) by default.
* The TCP dissector gained a new “Reassemble out-of-order segments” preference
  to fix dissection and decryption issues in case TCP segments are received
  out-of-order. See the User’s Guide, chapter _TCP Reassembly_ for details.
* Decryption support for the new WireGuard dissector (wsbuglink:15011[], requires Libgcrypt 1.8).
* The BOOTP dissector has been renamed to DHCP. With the exception of
  “bootp.dhcp”, the old “bootp.*” display filter fields are still supported
  but may be removed in a future release.
* The SSL dissector has been renamed to TLS. As with BOOTP the old
  “ssl.*” display filter fields are supported but may be removed in a
  future release.
* Coloring rules, IO graphs, Filter Buttons and protocol preference tables
  can now be copied from other profiles using a button in the corresponding
  configuration dialogs.
* APT-X has been renamed to aptX.
* When importing from hex dump, it's now possible to add an ExportPDU header with a payload name. This
  calls the specific dissector directly without lower protocols.
* The sshdump and ciscodump extcap interfaces can now use a proxy for the SSH connection.
* Dumpcap now supports the `-a packets:NUM` and `-b packets:NUM` options.
* Wireshark now includes a “No Reassembly” configuration profile.
* Wireshark now supports the Russian language.
* The build system now supports AppImage packages.
* The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.12.0. Previously they
  shipped with Qt 5.9.7.
* Support for DTLS and TLS decryption using pcapng files that embed a Decryption
  Secrets Block (DSB) containing a TLS Key Log (wsbuglink:15252[]).
* The editcap utility gained a new `--inject-secrets` option to inject an
  existing TLS Key Log file into a pcapng file.
* A new dfilter function string() has been added. It allows the conversion of
  non-string fields to strings so string functions (as contains and matches)
  can be used on them.
* The Bash test suite has been replaced by one based on Python unittest/pytest.
* The custom window title can now show file path of the capture file and it has a conditional separator.

=== Removed Features and Support

* The legacy (GTK+) user interface has been removed and is no longer supported.
* The portaudio library is no longer needed due to the removal of GTK+.
* Wireshark requires Qt 5.2 or later. Qt 4 is no longer supported.
* Wireshark requires GLib 2.32 or later.
* Wireshark requires GnuTLS 3.2 or later as optional dependency.
* Building Wireshark requires Python 3.4 or newer, Python 2.7 is unsupported.
* Building Wireshark requires CMake. Autotools is no longer supported.
* TShark’s `-z compare` option was removed.
* Building with Cygwin is no longer supported on Windows.

//_Non-empty section placeholder._

DisplayPort AUX channel data from linux kernel drivers.

sdjournal, an extcap that captures systemd journal entries.

=== Major API Changes

* Lua: the various logging functions (debug, info, message, warn and critical)
  have been removed. Use the print function instead for debugging purposes.
* Lua: on Windows, file-related functions such as dofile now assume UTF-8 paths
  instead of the local code page. This is consistent with Linux and macOS and
  improves compatibility on non-English systems. (wsbuglink:15118[])

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to find the default
locations on your system.

== Getting Help

The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

Community support is available on https://ask.wireshark.org/[Wireshark’s
Q&A site] and on the wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription
